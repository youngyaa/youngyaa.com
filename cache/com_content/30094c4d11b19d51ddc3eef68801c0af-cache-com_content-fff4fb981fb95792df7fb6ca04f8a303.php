		<h2 style="text-align: center;">Paper Cutting</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Chinese paper cutting is a traditional style of decorative art in China which dates back to the 6th century A.D. It has a wide range of distinct uses in Chinese culture, almost all of which are for health, prosperity or decorative purposes. Red is the dominant color used by the artisans and the cut out is also referred as window flower as it is used to decorate windows and doors. Paper cuttings often have a heavy emphasis on characters symbolizing the Chinese zodiac animals. As paper became more affordable, paper-cutting became to one of the important art styles in Chinese folk culture and the art form later spread to other parts of the world with different regions adopting their own cultural styles.</p>
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With a history of 1500 years, Chinese paper cut was listed in the UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists in 2009, representing cultural values of people throughout China. Paper cutting remains popular in contemporary China, especially during special events like the Chinese New Year or weddings. The art has evolved uniquely all over the world to adapt to different cultural styles.</p>

<p><img src="images/articles/culture/image011.jpg" alt="image011" style="margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto; display: block;" /></p>
<p><br />Sugar painting may have originated during the Ming dynasty when small animals made of sugar were created in molds for religious rituals. This art became more popular during the Qing dynasty after which the techniques improved, and a more diverse range of patterns emerged. In Sichuan, further developments were made in production, seeing the replacement of the molds with the now-common small ladle, often bronze or copper.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although techniques vary, normally the hot sugar is drizzled from a small ladle onto a flat surface, usually white marble or metal. The outline is produced with a relatively thick stream of sugar. Then, supporting strands of thinner sugar are placed to attached the outline, and fill in the body of the figure. These supporting strands may be produced with swirls, zig-zags, or other patterns. Finally, when completed, a thin wooden stick, used to hold the figure, is attached in two or more places with more sugar. While still warm and pliable, figure is removed from the surface using a spatula-like tool, and is sold to the waiting customer, or placed on display. Customers (especially children) usually select a figure by spinning the arrow on a wheel which will randomly land on such popular figures as a dragon, fish, monkey, dog, bird etc.</p>

<p><br />Bingtanghulu is a traditional Chinese snack of candied fruit. It originated from northern China, which is now commonly available in most Chinese cities, such as Beijing, Tianjin, and Shanghai. It consists of fruits covered in hard candy on bamboo skewers that are approximately 20cm long.</p>
<p><br />The two common names refer to "sugar bottle gourd" and "rock sugar bottle gourd" respectively. The "sugar" or "rock sugar" refers to the sugar coating, while the "bottle gourd" refers to the slight resemblance of the snack to the shape of that fruit.<br />Bingtanghulu typically has a hardened sugar coating that comes from dipping the skewer in sugar syrup, but versions can also be found with a second chocolate coating, or sesame sprinkles. Traditionally, the fruit used has been Chinese hawthorn, but in recent times vendors have also used various other fruits, such as cherry tomatoes, mandarin oranges, strawberries, blueberries, pineapples, kiwifruit, bananas or grapes.</p>

<p><br />Peking opera or Beijing opera (Jīngj&ugrave;) is a form of traditional Chinese theatre which combines music, vocal performance, mime, dance, and acrobatics. It arose in the late 18th century and became fully developed and recognized by the mid-19th century. The form was extremely popular in the Qing dynasty court and has come to be regarded as one of the cultural treasures of China. Major performance troupes are based in Beijing and Tianjin, and Shanghai in the south. The art form is also preserved in Taiwan, where it is known as National theatre (Guoju). It has also spread to other countries such as the United States and Japan.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Beijing Opera is developed from absorbing many other dramatic forms, mostly from the local drama 'Huiban' which was popular in South China during the 18th century. It is a scenic art integrating music, performance, literature, aria, and face-painting. The combination of virtual and reality - a special technique of expression, keeps it largely free from the restriction of time and space on stage performance.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">The Art of Chinese Mask Changing (Bian Lian)</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bian Lian is an ancient Chinese dramatic art that is part of the more general Sichuan opera. Performers wear brightly colored costumes and move to quick, dramatic music. They also wear vividly colored masks, typically depicting well known characters from the opera, which they change from one face to another almost instantaneously with the swipe of a fan, a movement of the head, or wave of the hand.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Face-changing, or "bi&agrave;n liǎn", an important subgenre of Chinese Sichuan opera, is popular in eastern and central Sichuan, Chongqing, Guizhou and Yunnan Province. The secret of the face change has been passed down from one generation to the next within families. Traditionally, only males were permitted to learn Bian Lian.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Chinese Calligraphy</h2>

<p><br />Chinese calligraphy is a form of calligraphy widely practiced in China and revered in the Chinese cultural sphere. With a general standardization of the various styles, the calligraphic tradition of East Asia originated and developed from China. Chinese calligraphy and ink and wash painting are closely related, since they are accomplished using similar tools and techniques. Chinese painting and calligraphy distinguish themselves from other cultural arts because they emphasize motion and are charged with dynamic life. According to Stanley-Baker, "Calligraphy is sheer life experienced through energy in motion that is registered as traces on silk or paper, with time and rhythm in shifting space its main ingredients." Calligraphy has also led to the development of many forms of art in China, including seal carving, ornate paperweights, and inkstones.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The ink brush, ink, paper, and inkstone are essential implements of Chinese calligraphy. They are known together as the Four Treasures of the Study. In addition to these four tools, a water-dropper, desk pads and paperweights are also used by calligraphers.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;Chinese Ink Painting</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="images/articles/culture/image039.jpg" alt="image039" style="margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto; display: block;" /></p>
<p><br />Textual evidence suggests that Shan shui style painting existed during China's Liu Song dynasty of the fifth century. Ink wash painting developed further during the Tang Dynasty (618&ndash;907). The 8th-century poet/painter Wang Wei is generally credited as the painter who applied color to existing ink wash paintings.[1] The art was further developed into a more polished style during the Song Dynasty (960&ndash;1279).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Asian aesthetic writing is generally consistent in stating the goal of ink and wash painting is not simply to reproduce the appearance of the subject, but to capture its spirit. In landscape painting the scenes depicted are typically imaginary or very loose adaptations of actual views. Ink wash painting uses tonality and shading achieved by varying the ink density, both by differential grinding of the ink stick in water and by varying the ink load and pressure within a single brushstroke. Ink wash painting artists spend years practicing basic brush strokes to refine their brush movement and ink flow. In the hand of a master, a single stroke can produce astonishing variations in tonality, from deep black to silvery gray.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;Chinese Traditional Music</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="images/articles/culture/image041.jpg" alt="image041" style="margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto; display: block;" /></p>
<p><br />Music from the &ldquo;classical tradition&rdquo; refers to art music or &ldquo;sophisticated&rdquo; music composed by scholars and literati in China&rsquo;s historical past. Chinese classical music often has thematic, poetic or philosophical associations and is typically played solo, on instruments such as the qin (commonly known as guqin), 7-string zither with over 3000 years of well-documented history, or the pipa, a lute with over 2000 years of history.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Traditional music in the classical sense is intimately linked to poetry and to various forms of lyric drama, and is more or less poetry without words. In the same manner as poetry, music sets out to express human feelings, soothe suffering and bring spiritual elevation. The instruments demand not only a mastery of technique but a high degree of sensitivity (and inner power) to evoke the subtle sonorities and deep emotional expression. This type of music has come down to us as an oral tradition from masters to students, although written scores that combine numbers and symbols representing pitch and finger techniques respectively have been in use for nearly two thousand years.</p>

<p><br />Crosstalk, also known by its Chinese name xiangsheng, is a traditional Chinese comedic performance in the form of a dialogue between two performers, or, much less often, a solo monologue or, even less frequently, a multi-person dialogue. The language, rich in puns and allusions, is delivered in a rapid, bantering style. Crosstalk is one of China's foremost and most popular performing arts, and is typically performed in the Beijing dialect (or in Standard Chinese with a strong Northern Chinese accent). The acts would sometimes include singing and musical instruments.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Crosstalk is generally thought to have taken form in the late Qing Dynasty, particularly during the rule of the Xianfeng Emperor and the Tongzhi Emperor in the mid-1800s, although its roots may extend as far back as the Ming Dynasty. It began as a form of street performance incorporating joke-telling, comedic banter, imitations, or borrowing from other forms of performance art such as Peking Opera, all with the express purpose of making audiences laugh. By the early days of the Republic of China, crosstalk had evolved to the format as it is known today, being performed in teahouses and theatres as well as, eventually, on radio and television.</p>

<p><br />Chinese poetry is poetry written, spoken, or chanted in the Chinese language. While this last term comprises Classical Chinese, Standard Chinese, Mandarin Chinese, Yue Chinese, and other historical and vernacular forms of the language, its poetry generally falls into one of two primary types, Classical Chinese poetry and Modern Chinese poetry.</p>
<p><br />Poetry has consistently been held in extremely high regard in China, often incorporating expressive folk influences filtered through the minds of Chinese literati. In Chinese culture, poetry has provided a format and a forum for both public and private expressions of deep emotion, offering an audience of peers, readers, and scholars&rsquo; insight into the inner life of Chinese writers across more than two millennia. Westerners also have found in it an interesting and pleasurable field of study, in its exemplification of essential contrasts between the Western world and Chinese civilization, and on its own terms.</p>
