PLG_SYS_TOPOFTHEPAGE_LANGUAGE_LABEL="<h2>Changing the Button Text</h2>
<p>Unlike other plugins which provide a text configuration field to change the button text (but only display the text in one language), Top of the Page adheres to a strict policy of using only Joomla translation files to ensure the plugin is compatible with ALL languages simultaneously.  If your site provides more than one language, Top of the Page can accommodate each language with a button that displays your button text in the appropriate language, regardless of the number of languages your site supports.</p>
<p>The ONLY method to alter the button text for ALL languages is to use a language override.  Joomla provides this facility in the language manager.</p>
<p>Follow these seven steps to change the button text.</p>
<ol>
<li style=\"list-style:decimal;padding:5px;\">Open the <a href=\"index.php?option=com_languages&view=overrides\" onclick=\"window.open(this.href);return false;\">Language Manager/Overrides</a>.
<ul><li style=\"list-style:disc;padding:5px;\">(this link opens in a new window)</li></ul>
</li>
<li style=\"list-style:decimal;padding:5px;\">Use the &quot;Filter&quot; dropdown to select xx-XX (Your Language) - <em>Administrator</em> (the -Administrator portion is IMPORTANT)</li>
<li style=\"list-style:decimal;padding:5px;\">Press the &quot;New&quot; button to create a new override.</li>
<li style=\"list-style:decimal;padding:5px;\">In the &quot;Language Constant&quot; field, type <em>PLG_SYS_TOPOFTHEPAGE_GOTOTOP</em></li>
<li style=\"list-style:decimal;padding:5px;\">In the &quot;Text&quot; field, type the new text for your button.  Maybe something like <em>Beam me up!</em></li>
<li style=\"list-style:decimal;padding:5px;\">Press the &quot;Save &amp; Close&quot; button.</li>
<li style=\"list-style:decimal;padding:5px;\">Bask in the glory of your successful button text language override.</li>
</ol>
<p>Changing the button text is the most common support request I receive, and the most common complaint is that it isn't easier to do.  In order to provide the best possible extensions, I make decisions for the greater good of functionality at the expense of convenience.  To answer the most often asked question - yes, I could have given a text field, but I would then have limited your button to one language and that is something I refuse to do.  Hopefully, this instruction eases the pain of changing the button text.</p>
<p>I hope you enjoy the extension.<br/><em>Michael Richey</em></p>

PLG_SYS_TOPOFTHEPAGE_ICON_DESC="<p>If you're using an icon font such as Font Awesome or Icomoon included with Joomla 3.x - you can specify the icon class of an icon to be included in your button.  If your button includes text, a space will be added to separate the icon from the text.</p><p>The icon can be separately styled using #gototop span.  It can also receive a separate hover style. GO NUTS!</p><p>Try testing with \"icon-home\" if you use Icomoon.</p>"
